Scope
=====

Scope is a library for creating code templates with pure Python code. Its goal
is to allow defining a simple and clear structure for code templates, by
offering a basic set of utilities that can be extended for providing language
-specific constructs. It basically offers an internal DSL
(http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html) for defining and
serializing templates in Python.

For this first release, it's provided a basic set for generating C++ code, but
I will be extending to support more languages over time.

Scope is based in Brev√© (http://breve.twisty-industries.com/), a similar tool
for generating HTML, and I created it so I can use it in another one of my
projects, spgen (https://github.com/lrgar/spgen), but I intend to fully support
the project.


Example
=======

You can define a simple template as the following code, 

    import scope.lang.cpp as cpp
    import scope

    template = cpp.tfile [
        '#include <string>',

        cpp.tclass(name='App') [
            cpp.tattribute('std::string', '_name'),

            cpp.tmethod('std::string', 'GetName', visibility=cpp.PUBLIC,
                        const=True) [
                'return this->_name;'
            ],

            cpp.tmethod('void', 'SetName', ['const std::string & value'],
                        visibility=cpp.PUBLIC) [
                'this->_name = value;'
            ]
        ]
    ]

With the template you can just serialize it into a string with

    scope.serialize(template)

and then print it or save it as a file.
